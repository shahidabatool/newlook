The Oath of Citizenship

Le serment de citoyenneté

I swear (or affirm)
That I will be faithful
And bear true allegiance
To Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth the Second
Queen of Canada
Her Heirs and Successors
And that I will faithfully observe
The laws of Canada
Including the Constitution
Which recognizes and affirms
The Aboriginal and treaty rights of
First Nations, Inuit and Métis peoples
And fulfil my duties
As a Canadian citizen.

Je jure (ou j’affirme solennellement)
Que je serai fidèle
Et porterai sincère allégeance
À Sa Majesté
La reine Elizabeth Deux
Reine du Canada
À ses héritiers et successeurs
Que j’observerai fidèlement
Les lois du Canada
Y compris la Constitution
Qui reconnaît et confirme les droits
Ancestraux ou issus de traités
Des Premières Nations, des Inuits et des Métis
Et que je remplirai loyalement
Mes obligations
De citoyen canadien.

Understanding the Oath
In Canada, we profess our loyalty to a person who represents all Canadians and not to a document such
as a constitution, a banner such as a flag, or a geopolitical entity such as a country. In our constitutional
monarchy, these elements are encompassed by the Sovereign (Queen or King). It is a remarkably simple
yet powerful principle: Canada is personified by the Sovereign just as the Sovereign is personified by
Canada.

Welcome! It took courage to move to a new country. Your decision to apply for citizenship is
another big step. You are becoming part of a great tradition that was built by generations of pioneers
before you. Once you have met all the legal requirements, we hope to welcome you as a new citizen with
all the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.

Canada has welcomed generations of newcomers
to our shores to help us build a free, law-abiding
and prosperous society. For 400 years, settlers
and immigrants have contributed to the diversity
and richness of our country, which is built on a
proud history and a strong identity.
Canada is a constitutional monarchy, a
parliamentary democracy and a federal state.
Canadians are bound together by a shared
commitment to the rule of law and to the
institutions of parliamentary government.
Canadians take pride in their identity and have
made sacrifices to defend their way of life. By
coming to Canada and taking this important step
toward Canadian citizenship, you are helping to
write the continuing story of Canada.

Immigrants between the ages of 18 and 54 must
have adequate knowledge of English or French
in order to become Canadian citizens. You must
also learn about voting procedures, Canada’s
history, symbols, democratic institutions,
geography, and the rights and responsibilities of
citizenship.
Canadian citizens enjoy many rights, but
Canadians also have responsibilities. They must
obey Canada’s laws and respect the rights and
freedoms of others.
This guide will help you prepare to become a
Canadian citizen. Good luck!

Rights and Responsibilities
of Citizenship

The Equality of Women and Men
In Canada, men and women are equal under the law. Canada’s openness and generosity do not extend
to barbaric cultural practices that tolerate spousal abuse, “honour killings,” female genital mutilation,
forced marriage or other gender-based violence. Those guilty of these crimes are severely punished under
Canada’s criminal laws.

Canadian citizens have rights and responsibilities. These come to us from our history, are secured by
Canadian law, and reflect our shared traditions, identity and values.
Canadian law has several sources, including laws passed by Parliament and the provincial legislatures,
English common law, the civil code of France and the unwritten constitution that we have inherited from
Great Britain.

• Freedom of association.
Habeas corpus, the right to challenge unlawful
detention by the state, comes from English
common law.
The Constitution of Canada was amended in
1982 to entrench the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms, which begins with the words,
Queen Elizabeth II
proclaiming the
amended Constitution,
Ottawa, 1982

• Aboriginal Peoples’ Rights — The rights
guaranteed in the Charter will not adversely
affect any treaty or other rights or freedoms of
Aboriginal peoples.
• Official Language Rights and Minority
Language Educational Rights — French and
English have equal status in Parliament and
throughout the government.
• Multiculturalism — A fundamental
characteristic of the Canadian heritage and
identity. Canadians celebrate the gift of one
another’s presence and work hard to respect
pluralism and live in harmony.

• Taking responsibility for oneself and one’s
family — Getting a job, taking care of one’s
family and working hard in keeping with one’s
abilities are important Canadian values. Work
contributes to personal dignity and selfrespect, and to Canada’s prosperity.
• Serving on a jury — When called to do so, you
are legally required to serve. Serving on a jury is a
privilege that makes the justice system work as it
depends on impartial juries made up of citizens.

• Protecting and enjoying our heritage and
environment — Every citizen has a role to
play in avoiding waste and pollution while
protecting Canada’s natural, cultural and
architectural heritage for future generations.

Defending Canada
There is no compulsory military service in Canada. However, serving in the regular Canadian Forces
(navy, army and air force) is a noble way to contribute to Canada and an excellent career choice
(www.forces.ca). You can serve in your local part-time navy, militia and air reserves and gain valuable
experience, skills and contacts. Young people can learn discipline, responsibility and skills by getting
involved in the cadets (www.cadets.ca).
You may also serve in the Coast Guard or emergency services in your community such as a police force or
fire department. By helping to protect your community, you follow in the footsteps of Canadians before
you who made sacrifices in the service of our country.

da

• Freedom of peaceful assembly; and

• Mobility Rights — Canadians can live and
work anywhere they choose in Canada, enter
and leave the country freely, and apply for a
passport.

• Helping others in the community — Millions
of volunteers freely donate their time to help
others without pay—helping people in need,
assisting at your child’s school, volunteering
at a food bank or other charity, or encouraging
newcomers to integrate. Volunteering is an
excellent way to gain useful skills and develop
friends and contacts.

na

• Freedom of thought, belief, opinion and
expression, including freedom of speech and
of the press;

• Obeying the law — One of Canada’s founding
principles is the rule of law. Individuals and
governments are regulated by laws and not by
arbitrary actions. No person or group is above
the law.

Ca

The Charter attempts to summarize fundamental
freedoms while also setting out additional rights.
The most important of these include:

In Canada, rights come with responsibilities.
These include:

• Voting in elections — The right to vote comes
with a responsibility to vote in federal,
provincial or territorial and local elections.

“Whereas Canada is founded upon principles

Unity in Diversity
John Buchan, the 1st Baron Tweedsmuir, was a popular Governor General of Canada (1935–40). Immigrant
groups, he said, “should retain their individuality and each make its contribution to the national
character.” Each could learn “from the other, and … while they cherish their own special loyalties and
traditions, they cherish not less that new loyalty and tradition which springs from their union.” (Canadian
Club of Halifax, 1937). The 15th Governor General is shown here in Blood (Kainai First Nation) headdress.

Who We Are
Canada is known around the world as a strong and free country. Canadians are proud of their unique
identity. We have inherited the oldest continuous constitutional tradition in the world. We are the only
constitutional monarchy in North America. Our institutions uphold a commitment to Peace, Order and
Good Government, a key phrase in Canada’s original constitutional document in 1867, the British North
America Act. A belief in ordered liberty, enterprise, hard work and fair play has enabled Canadians to
build a prosperous society in a rugged environment from our Atlantic shores to the Pacific Ocean and to
the Arctic Circle—so much so that poets and songwriters have hailed Canada as the “Great Dominion.”
(From Top to Bottom)

The Inuit, which means “the people” in the
Inuktitut language, live in small, scattered
communities across the Arctic. Their knowledge
of the land, sea and wildlife enabled them to
adapt to one of the harshest environments on
earth.

The Métis are a distinct people of mixed
Aboriginal and European ancestry, the majority
of whom live in the Prairie provinces. They
come from both French- and English-speaking
backgrounds and speak their own dialect, Michif.
About 65% of the Aboriginal people are First
Nations, while 30% are Métis and 4% Inuit.

To understand what it means to be Canadian, it is important to know about our three founding peoples—
Aboriginal, French and British.

In today’s Canada, Aboriginal peoples enjoy
renewed pride and confidence, and have made
significant achievements in agriculture, the
environment, business and the arts.

Canadian society today stems largely from the
English-speaking and French-speaking Christian
civilizations that were brought here from Europe
by settlers. English and French define the
reality of day-to-day life for most people and
are the country’s official languages. The federal
government is required by law to provide services
throughout Canada in English and French.
Today, there are 18 million Anglophones—people
who speak English as a first language—and
seven million Francophones—people who speak
French as their first language. While the majority
of Francophones live in the province of Quebec,
one million Francophones live in Ontario,
New Brunswick and Manitoba, with a smaller
presence in other provinces. New Brunswick is
the only officially bilingual province.

The Acadians are the descendants of French
colonists who began settling in what are now
the Maritime provinces in 1604. Between 1755
and 1763, during the war between Britain and
France, more than two-thirds of the Acadians
were deported from their homeland. Despite
this ordeal, known as the “Great Upheaval,” the
Acadians survived and maintained their unique
identity. Today, Acadian culture is flourishing
and is a lively part of French-speaking Canada.
Quebecers are the people of Quebec, the vast
majority French-speaking. Most are descendants
of 8,500 French settlers from the 1600s and
1700s and maintain a unique identity, culture and
language. The House of Commons recognized in
2006 that the Quebecois form a nation within
a united Canada. One million Anglo-Quebecers
have a heritage of 250 years and form a vibrant
part of the Quebec fabric.

Aboriginal and treaty rights are in the Canadian
Constitution. Territorial rights were first
guaranteed through the Royal Proclamation of
1763 by King George III, and established the basis
for negotiating treaties with the newcomers—
treaties that were not always fully respected.

The ancestors of Aboriginal peoples are believed
to have migrated from Asia many thousands
of years ago. They were well established here
long before explorers from Europe first came
to North America. Diverse, vibrant First Nations
cultures were rooted in religious beliefs about
their relationship to the Creator, the natural
environment and each other.

schools were poorly funded and inflicted hardship
on the students; some were physically abused.
Aboriginal languages and cultural practices were
mostly prohibited. In 2008, Ottawa formally
apologized to the former students.

and is a lively part of French-speaking Canada.
Quebecers are the people of Quebec, the vast
majority French-speaking. Most are descendants
of 8,500 French settlers from the 1600s and
1700s and maintain a unique identity, culture and
language. The House of Commons recognized in
2006 that the Quebecois form a nation within
a united Canada. One million Anglo-Quebecers
have a heritage of 250 years and form a vibrant
part of the Quebec fabric.

Becoming Canadian
Some Canadians immigrate from places where they have experienced warfare or conflict. Such experiences
do not justify bringing to Canada violent, extreme or hateful prejudices. In becoming Canadian, newcomers
are expected to embrace democratic principles such as the rule of law.

The basic way of life in English-speaking areas
was established by hundreds of thousands
of English, Welsh, Scottish and Irish settlers,
soldiers and migrants from the 1600s to the 20th
century. Generations of pioneers and builders of

British origins, as well as other groups, invested
and endured hardship in laying the foundations
of our country. This helps explain why
Anglophones (English speakers) are generally
referred to as English Canadians.

In Canada the state has traditionally partnered

Canada’s History
Following the war, Great Britain renamed the
colony the “Province of Quebec.” The Frenchspeaking Catholic people, known as habitants
or Canadiens, strove to preserve their way of life
in the English-speaking, Protestant-ruled British
Empire.

John Cabot, an Italian
immigrant to England,
was the first to map
Canada’s Atlantic
shore, setting foot on
Newfoundland or Cape
Breton Island in 1497 and
claiming the New Founde
Land for England. English
settlement did not begin
until 1610

Struggle for a continent

The First Europeans

Exploring a river, naming Canada

The Vikings from Iceland who colonized
Greenland 1,000 years ago also reached Labrador
and the island of Newfoundland. The remains
of their settlement, l’Anse aux Meadows, are a
World Heritage site.

Between 1534 and 1542, Jacques Cartier made
three voyages across the Atlantic, claiming the
land for King Francis I of France. Cartier heard
two captured guides speak the Iroquoian word
kanata, meaning “village.” By the 1550s, the
name of Canada began appearing on maps.

European exploration began in earnest in 1497
with the expedition of John Cabot, who was the
first to draw a map of Canada’s East Coast.

In 1670, King Charles II of England granted the
Hudson’s Bay Company exclusive trading rights
over the watershed draining into Hudson Bay.
For the next 100 years the Company competed
with Montreal-based traders. The skilled and
courageous men who travelled by canoe were
called voyageurs and coureurs des bois, and
formed strong alliances with First Nations.
English colonies along the Atlantic seaboard,
dating from the early 1600s, eventually became
richer and more populous than New France. In
the 1700s France and Great Britain battled for
control of North America. In 1759, the British
defeated the French in the Battle of the Plains
of Abraham at Québec City — marking the end
of France’s empire in America. The commanders
of both armies, Brigadier James Wolfe and the
Marquis de Montcalm, were killed leading their
troops in battle.

To better govern the French Roman Catholic
majority, the British Parliament passed the
Quebec Act of 1774. One of the constitutional
foundations of Canada, the Quebec Act
accommodated the principles of British
institutions to the reality of the province. It
allowed religious freedom for Catholics and
permitted them to hold public office, a practice
not then allowed in Britain. The Quebec Act
restored French civil law while maintaining
British criminal law.

Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur
d’Iberville, was a great
hero of New France,
winning many victories
over the English, from
James Bay in the north to
Nevis in the Caribbean,

Sir Guy Carleton (Lord

of Quebec, defended the
rights of the Canadiens,

Quebec in 1775, and
supervised the Loyalist
migration to Nova Scotia
and Quebec in 1782–83

United empire loyalists
In 1776, the 13 British colonies to the south of
Quebec declared independence and formed the
United States. North America was again divided
by war. More than 40,000 people loyal to the
Crown, called “Loyalists,” fled the oppression
of the American Revolution to settle in Nova
Scotia and Quebec. Joseph Brant led thousands
of Loyalist Mohawk Indians into Canada. The
Loyalists came from Dutch, German, British,
Scandinavian, Aboriginal and other origins
and from Presbyterian, Anglican, Baptist,
Methodist, Jewish, Quaker and Catholic religious
backgrounds. About 3,000 black Loyalists,
freedmen and slaves came north seeking a better
life. In turn, in 1792, some black Nova Scotians,
who were given poor land, moved on to establish
Freetown, Sierra Leone (West Africa), a new
British colony for freed slaves.

In 1608 Champlain built a fortress at what is now

harsh climate. Champlain allied the colony with
the Algonquin, Montagnais and Huron, historic
enemies of the Iroquois, a confederation of five
(later six) First Nations who battled with the
French settlements for a century. The French and
the Iroquois made peace in 1701.

and on exporting natural resources such as fur,
fish and timber, transported by roads, lakes,
rivers and canals.

By 1814, the American attempt to conquer Canada had failed. The British paid for a costly Canadian
defence system, including the Citadels at Halifax and Québec City, the naval drydock at Halifax and
Fort Henry at Kingston—today popular historic sites. The present-day Canada-U.S.A. border is partly an
outcome of the War of 1812, which ensured that Canada would remain independent of the United States.

Democratic institutions developed gradually and peacefully. The first representative assembly was
elected in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1758. Prince Edward Island followed in 1773, New Brunswick in 1785.

The Beginnings of Democracy

After the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte’s fleet in the Battle of Trafalgar (1805), the Royal Navy ruled the
waves. The British Empire, which included Canada, fought to resist Bonaparte’s bid to dominate Europe.
This led to American resentment at British interference with their shipping. Believing it would be easy to
conquer Canada, the United States launched an invasion in June 1812. The Americans were mistaken.
Canadian volunteers and First Nations, including Shawnee led by Chief Tecumseh, supported British
soldiers in Canada’s defence. In July, Major-General Sir Isaac Brock captured Detroit but was killed while
defending against an American attack at Queenston Heights, near Niagara Falls, a battle the Americans
lost. In 1813, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles de Salaberry and 460 soldiers, mostly French Canadiens,
turned back 4,000 American invaders at Châteauguay, south of Montreal. In 1813 the Americans
burned Government House and the Parliament Buildings in York (now Toronto). In retaliation in 1814,
Major-General Robert Ross led an expedition from Nova Scotia that burned down the White House and
other public buildings in Washington, D.C. Ross died in battle soon afterwards and was buried in Halifax
with full military honours.

sent some of his best
soldiers to defend
Canada in 1814. He then
chose Bytown (Ottawa)
as the endpoint of the
Rideau Canal, part
of a network of forts
to prevent the U.S.A.
from invading Canada
again. Wellington, who
defeated Napoleon in
1815, therefore played
a direct role in founding

The Act also granted to the Canadas, for the first time, legislative assemblies elected by the people. The
name Canada also became official at this time and has been used ever since. The Atlantic colonies and
the two Canadas were known collectively as British North America.

By 1814, the American attempt to conquer Canada had failed. The British paid for a costly Canadian
defence system, including the Citadels at Halifax and Québec City, the naval drydock at Halifax and
Fort Henry at Kingston—today popular historic sites. The present-day Canada-U.S.A. border is partly an
outcome of the War of 1812, which ensured that Canada would remain independent of the United States.

Democratic institutions developed gradually and peacefully. The first representative assembly was
elected in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1758. Prince Edward Island followed in 1773, New Brunswick in 1785.
The Constitutional Act of 1791 divided the Province of Quebec into Upper Canada (later Ontario), which
was mainly Loyalist, Protestant and English-speaking, and Lower Canada (later Quebec), heavily Catholic
and French-speaking.

The Beginnings of Democracy

After the defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte’s fleet in the Battle of Trafalgar (1805), the Royal Navy ruled the
waves. The British Empire, which included Canada, fought to resist Bonaparte’s bid to dominate Europe.
This led to American resentment at British interference with their shipping. Believing it would be easy to
conquer Canada, the United States launched an invasion in June 1812. The Americans were mistaken.
Canadian volunteers and First Nations, including Shawnee led by Chief Tecumseh, supported British
soldiers in Canada’s defence. In July, Major-General Sir Isaac Brock captured Detroit but was killed while
defending against an American attack at Queenston Heights, near Niagara Falls, a battle the Americans
lost. In 1813, Lieutenant-Colonel Charles de Salaberry and 460 soldiers, mostly French Canadiens,
turned back 4,000 American invaders at Châteauguay, south of Montreal. In 1813 the Americans
burned Government House and the Parliament Buildings in York (now Toronto). In retaliation in 1814,
Major-General Robert Ross led an expedition from Nova Scotia that burned down the White House and
other public buildings in Washington, D.C. Ross died in battle soon afterwards and was buried in Halifax
with full military honours.

Controversially, Lord Durham also said that
the quickest way for the Canadiens to achieve
progress was to assimilate into English-speaking
Protestant culture. This recommendation
demonstrated a complete lack of understanding
of French Canadians, who sought to uphold the
distinct identity of French Canada.
Some reformers, including Sir Étienne-Paschal
Taché and Sir George-Étienne Cartier, later
became Fathers of Confederation, as did a former
member of the voluntary government militia in
Upper Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald.

Responsible government

The first British North American colony to attain
full responsible government was Nova Scotia
in 1847–48. In 1848–49 the governor of United
Canada, Lord Elgin, with encouragement from
London, introduced responsible government.
This is the system that we have today: if
the government loses a confidence vote in
the assembly it must resign. La Fontaine, a
champion of democracy and French language
rights, became the first leader of a responsible
government in the Canadas.

1905 – Alberta, Saskatchewan

In 1867, Sir John Alexander Macdonald, a Father
of Confederation, became Canada’s first Prime
Minister. Born in Scotland on January 11, 1815,
he came to Upper Canada as a child. He was a
lawyer in Kingston, Ontario, a gifted politician
and a colourful personality. Parliament has
recognized January 11 as Sir John A. Macdonald
Day. His portrait is on the $10 bill.

Did you know? In the 1920s, some believed
that the British West Indies (British territories
in the Caribbean Sea) should become part of
Canada. This did not occur, though Canada
and Commonwealth Caribbean countries and
territories enjoy close ties today.

Confederation

Challenge in the west

From 1864 to 1867, representatives of Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick and the Province of
Canada, with British support, worked together to
establish a new country. These men are known
as the Fathers of Confederation. They created two
levels of government: federal and provincial. The
old Province of Canada was split into two new
provinces: Ontario and Quebec, which, together
with New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, formed the
new country called the Dominion of Canada. Each
province would elect its own legislature and have
control of such areas as education and health.

When Canada took over the vast northwest region
from the Hudson’s Bay Company in 1869, the
12,000 Métis of the Red River were not consulted.
In response, Louis Riel led an armed uprising and
seized Fort Garry, the territorial capital. Canada’s
future was in jeopardy. How could the Dominion
reach from sea to sea if it could not control the
interior?

The British Parliament passed the British North
America Act in 1867. The Dominion of Canada
was officially born on July 1, 1867. Until 1982,
July 1 was celebrated as “Dominion Day” to
commemorate the day that Canada became a
self-governing Dominion. Today it is officially
known as Canada Day.

a decision that was strongly opposed in Quebec.
Riel is seen by many as a hero, a defender of
Métis rights and the father of Manitoba.
After the first Métis uprising, Prime Minister
Macdonald established the North West Mounted
Police (NWMP) in 1873 to pacify the West and
assist in negotiations with the Indians. The
NWMP founded Fort Calgary, Fort MacLeod and
other centres that today are cities and towns.
Regina became its headquarters. Today, the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP or “the
Mounties”) are the national police force and
one of Canada’s best-known symbols. Some of
Canada’s most colourful heroes, such as MajorGeneral Sir Sam Steele, came from the ranks of
the Mounties.

British Columbia joined Canada in 1871 after Ottawa promised to build a railway to the West Coast. On
November 7, 1885, a powerful symbol of unity was completed when Donald Smith (Lord Strathcona), the
Scottish-born director of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), drove the last spike. The project was financed
by British and American investors and built by both European and Chinese labour. Afterwards the Chinese
were subject to discrimination, including the Head Tax, a race-based entry fee. The Government of Canada
apologized in 2006 for this discriminatory policy. After many years of heroic work, the CPR’s “ribbons of

In order to defeat Nazism and Fascism, the Allies invaded Nazi-occupied Europe. Canadians took
part in the liberation of Italy in 1943–44. In the epic invasion of Normandy in northern France on
June 6, 1944, known as D-Day, 15,000 Canadian troops stormed and captured Juno Beach from the German
Army, a great national achievement shown in this painting by Orville Fisher. Approximately one in ten
Allied soldiers on D-Day was Canadian. The Canadian Army liberated the Netherlands in 1944–45 and
helped force the German surrender of May 8, 1945, bringing to an end six years of war in Europe.

The “Roaring Twenties” were boom times,
with prosperity for businesses and low
unemployment. The stock market crash of 1929,
however, led to the Great Depression or the “Dirty
Thirties.” Unemployment reached 27% in 1933
and many businesses were wiped out. Farmers
in Western Canada were hit hardest by low grain
prices and a terrible drought.

track and field champion.
Born in British Guiana, he
won bronze medals for
Canada in the 1928, 1932
and 1936 Olympics, then
graduated from McGill
University Medical School.
He served as a captain in the

Second World War and, as a
Montreal doctor, became an

The Canadians fought bravely and suffered
losses in the unsuccessful defence of Hong
Kong (1941) from attack by Imperial Japan, and
in a failed raid on Nazi-controlled Dieppe on the
coast of France (1942).
The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) took part
in the Battle of Britain and provided a high
proportion of Commonwealth aircrew in bombers
and fighter planes over Europe. Moreover,
Canada contributed more to the Allied air effort
than any other Commonwealth country, with over
130,000 Allied air crew trained in Canada under
the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.

In the Pacific war, Japan invaded the Aleutian
Islands, attacked a lighthouse on Vancouver
Island, launched fire balloons over B.C. and
the Prairies, and grossly maltreated Canadian
prisoners of war captured at Hong Kong. Japan
surrendered on August 14, 1945—the end of four
years of war in the Pacific.
Regrettably, the state of war and public opinion
in B.C. led to the forcible relocation of Canadians
of Japanese origin by the federal government and
the sale of their property without compensation.
This occurred even though the military and the
RCMP told Ottawa that they posed little danger to
Canada. The Government of Canada apologized
in 1988 for wartime wrongs and compensated the
victims.

More than one million Canadians and
Newfoundlanders (Newfoundland was a separate
British entity) served in the Second World War,
out of a population of 11.5 million. This was a
high proportion and of these, 44,000 were killed.

There was growing demand for the government to
create a social safety net with minimum wages,
a standard work week and programs such as
unemployment insurance. The Bank of Canada,
a central bank to manage the money supply
and bring stability to the financial system, was
created in 1934. Immigration dropped and many
refugees were turned away, including Jews trying
to flee Nazi Germany in 1939.

The Second World War began in 1939 when Adolf
Hitler, the National Socialist (Nazi) dictator of
Germany, invaded Poland and conquered much
of Europe. Canada joined with its democratic
allies in the fight to defeat tyranny by force of
arms.

The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) saw its finest
hour in the Battle of the Atlantic, protecting

In order to defeat Nazism and Fascism, the Allies invaded Nazi-occupied Europe. Canadians took
part in the liberation of Italy in 1943–44. In the epic invasion of Normandy in northern France on
June 6, 1944, known as D-Day, 15,000 Canadian troops stormed and captured Juno Beach from the German
Army, a great national achievement shown in this painting by Orville Fisher. Approximately one in ten
Allied soldiers on D-Day was Canadian. The Canadian Army liberated the Netherlands in 1944–45 and
helped force the German surrender of May 8, 1945, bringing to an end six years of war in Europe.

The “Roaring Twenties” were boom times,
with prosperity for businesses and low
unemployment. The stock market crash of 1929,
however, led to the Great Depression or the “Dirty
Thirties.” Unemployment reached 27% in 1933
and many businesses were wiped out. Farmers
in Western Canada were hit hardest by low grain
prices and a terrible drought.

The Second World War

Phil Edwards was a Canadian
track and field champion.
Born in British Guiana, he
won bronze medals for
Canada in the 1928, 1932
and 1936 Olympics, then
graduated from McGill
University Medical School.
He served as a captain in the
Canadian Army during the
Second World War and, as a
Montreal doctor, became an
expert in tropical diseases

The Canadians fought bravely and suffered
losses in the unsuccessful defence of Hong
Kong (1941) from attack by Imperial Japan, and
in a failed raid on Nazi-controlled Dieppe on the
coast of France (1942).
The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) took part
in the Battle of Britain and provided a high
proportion of Commonwealth aircrew in bombers
and fighter planes over Europe. Moreover,
Canada contributed more to the Allied air effort
than any other Commonwealth country, with over
130,000 Allied air crew trained in Canada under
the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.

In the Pacific war, Japan invaded the Aleutian
Islands, attacked a lighthouse on Vancouver
Island, launched fire balloons over B.C. and
the Prairies, and grossly maltreated Canadian
prisoners of war captured at Hong Kong. Japan
surrendered on August 14, 1945—the end of four
years of war in the Pacific.
Regrettably, the state of war and public opinion
in B.C. led to the forcible relocation of Canadians
of Japanese origin by the federal government and
the sale of their property without compensation.
This occurred even though the military and the
RCMP told Ottawa that they posed little danger to
Canada. The Government of Canada apologized
in 1988 for wartime wrongs and compensated the
victims.

da

More than one million Canadians and
Newfoundlanders (Newfoundland was a separate
British entity) served in the Second World War,
out of a population of 11.5 million. This was a
high proportion and of these, 44,000 were killed.

na

There was growing demand for the government to
create a social safety net with minimum wages,
a standard work week and programs such as
unemployment insurance. The Bank of Canada,
a central bank to manage the money supply
and bring stability to the financial system, was
created in 1934. Immigration dropped and many
refugees were turned away, including Jews trying
to flee Nazi Germany in 1939.

The Second World War began in 1939 when Adolf
Hitler, the National Socialist (Nazi) dictator of
Germany, invaded Poland and conquered much
of Europe. Canada joined with its democratic
allies in the fight to defeat tyranny by force of
arms.

The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) saw its finest
hour in the Battle of the Atlantic, protecting
convoys of merchant ships against German
submarines. Canada’s Merchant Navy helped
to feed, clothe and resupply Britain. At the end
of the Second World War, Canada had the thirdlargest navy in the world.

Trade and economic growth

A Changing Society

Arts and culture in Canada

Postwar Canada enjoyed record prosperity and
material progress. The world’s restrictive trading
policies in the Depression era were opened up
by such treaties as the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), now the World Trade
Organization (WTO). The discovery of oil in
Alberta in 1947 began Canada’s modern energy
industry. In 1951, for the first time, a majority of
Canadians were able to afford adequate food,
shelter and clothing. Between 1945 and 1970,
as Canada drew closer to the United States and
other trading partners, the country enjoyed one
of the strongest economies among industrialized
nations. Today, Canadians enjoy one of the
world’s highest standards of living—maintained
by the hard work of Canadians and by trade with
other nations, in particular the United States.

As social values changed over more than
50 years, Canada became a more flexible and
open society. Many took advantage of expanding
secondary and postsecondary educational
opportunities and a growing number of women
entered the professional work force.

Canadian artists have a long history of
achievement in which Canadians take pride.
Artists from all regions reflect and define our
culture and forms of creative expression and
have achieved greatness both at home and
abroad.

Most Canadians of Asian descent had in the past
been denied the vote in federal and provincial
elections. In 1948 the last of these, the JapaneseCanadians, gained the right to vote. Aboriginal
people were granted the vote in 1960. Today
every citizen over the age of 18 may vote.
Canada welcomed thousands of refugees from
Communist oppression, including about 37,000
who escaped Soviet tyranny in Hungary in 1956.
With the Communist victory in the Vietnam War
in 1975, many Vietnamese fled, including over
50,000 who sought refuge in Canada.
The idea of multiculturalism, as a result of
19th- and 20th-century immigration, gained a new
impetus. By the 1960s, one-third of Canadians
had origins that were neither British nor French,
and took pride in preserving their distinct culture
in the Canadian fabric. Today, diversity enriches
Canadians’ lives, particularly in our cities.

Canada has a long and respected performing arts
history, with a network of regional theatres and

Biculturalism. This led to the Official Languages
Act (1969), which guarantees French and English
services in the federal government across
Canada. In 1970, Canada helped found La

French-speaking countries.

In the visual arts, Canada is historically perhaps
best known for the Group of Seven, founded

Federal state

Parliamentary democracy

There are federal, provincial, territorial and municipal
governments in Canada. The responsibilities of the
federal and provincial governments were defined in
1867 in the British North America Act, now known as
the Constitution Act, 1867.

In Canada’s parliamentary democracy, the people
elect members to the House of Commons in Ottawa
and to the provincial and territorial legislatures.
These representatives are responsible for passing
laws, approving and monitoring expenditures,
and keeping the government accountable.
Cabinet ministers are responsible to the elected
representatives, which means they must retain
the “confidence of the House” and have to resign
if they are defeated in a non-confidence vote.

In our federal state, the federal government
takes responsibility for matters of national and
international concern. These include defence,
foreign policy, interprovincial trade and
communications, currency, navigation, criminal
law and citizenship. The provinces are responsible
for municipal government, education, health,
natural resources, property and civil rights,
and highways. The federal government and the
provinces share jurisdiction over agriculture
and immigration. Federalism allows different
provinces to adopt policies tailored to their own
populations, and gives provinces the flexibility to
experiment with new ideas and policies.
Every province has its own elected Legislative
Assembly, like the House of Commons in Ottawa.
The three northern territories, which have small
populations, do not have the status of provinces,
but their governments and assemblies carry out
many of the same functions.

Parliament has three parts: the Sovereign (Queen
or King), the Senate and the House of Commons.
Provincial legislatures comprise the Lieutenant
Governor and the elected Assembly.
In the federal government, the Prime Minister
selects the Cabinet ministers and is responsible for
the operations and policy of the government. The
House of Commons is the representative chamber,
made up of members of Parliament elected by the
people, traditionally every four years. Senators are
appointed by the Governor General on the advice
of the Prime Minister and serve until age 75. Both
the House of Commons and the Senate consider
and review bills (proposals for new laws). No
bill can become law in Canada until it has been
passed by both chambers and has received royal
assent, granted by the Governor General on behalf
of the Sovereign.

As a constitutional monarchy, Canada’s Head of
State is a hereditary Sovereign (Queen or King),
who reigns in accordance with the Constitution:
the rule of law. The Sovereign is a part of
Parliament, playing an important, non-partisan
role as the focus of citizenship and allegiance,
most visibly during royal visits to Canada. Her
Majesty is a symbol of Canadian sovereignty,
a guardian of constitutional freedoms, and a
reflection of our history. The Royal Family’s
example of lifelong service to the community is
an encouragement for citizens to give their best
to their country. As Head of the Commonwealth,
the Sovereign links Canada to 53 other nations
that cooperate to advance social, economic
and cultural progress. Other constitutional
monarchies include Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
Australia, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Spain,
Thailand, Japan, Jordan and Morocco.
There is a clear distinction in Canada between
the head of state—the Sovereign—and the head
of government—the Prime Minister, who actually
directs the governing of the country.
The Sovereign is represented in Canada by the
Governor General, who is appointed by the
Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister,
usually for five years. In each of the ten provinces,
the Sovereign is represented by the Lieutenant
Governor, who is appointed by the Governor
General on the advice of the Prime Minister, also
normally for five years.

Each provincial and territorial government has
an elected legislature where provincial and
territorial laws are passed. The members of the
legislature are called members of the Legislative
Assembly (MLAs), members of the National
Assembly (MNAs), members of the Provincial

Federal state

Parliamentary democracy

There are federal, provincial, territorial and municipal
governments in Canada. The responsibilities of the
federal and provincial governments were defined in
1867 in the British North America Act, now known as
the Constitution Act, 1867.

In Canada’s parliamentary democracy, the people
elect members to the House of Commons in Ottawa
and to the provincial and territorial legislatures.
These representatives are responsible for passing
laws, approving and monitoring expenditures,
and keeping the government accountable.
Cabinet ministers are responsible to the elected
representatives, which means they must retain
the “confidence of the House” and have to resign
if they are defeated in a non-confidence vote.

In our federal state, the federal government
takes responsibility for matters of national and
international concern. These include defence,
foreign policy, interprovincial trade and
communications, currency, navigation, criminal
law and citizenship. The provinces are responsible
for municipal government, education, health,
natural resources, property and civil rights,
and highways. The federal government and the
provinces share jurisdiction over agriculture
and immigration. Federalism allows different
provinces to adopt policies tailored to their own
populations, and gives provinces the flexibility to
experiment with new ideas and policies.
Every province has its own elected Legislative
Assembly, like the House of Commons in Ottawa.
The three northern territories, which have small
populations, do not have the status of provinces,
but their governments and assemblies carry out
many of the same functions.

Parliament has three parts: the Sovereign (Queen
or King), the Senate and the House of Commons.
Provincial legislatures comprise the Lieutenant
Governor and the elected Assembly.
In the federal government, the Prime Minister
selects the Cabinet ministers and is responsible for
the operations and policy of the government. The
House of Commons is the representative chamber,
made up of members of Parliament elected by the
people, traditionally every four years. Senators are
appointed by the Governor General on the advice
of the Prime Minister and serve until age 75. Both
the House of Commons and the Senate consider
and review bills (proposals for new laws). No
bill can become law in Canada until it has been
passed by both chambers and has received royal
assent, granted by the Governor General on behalf
of the Sovereign.

As a constitutional monarchy, Canada’s Head of
State is a hereditary Sovereign (Queen or King),
who reigns in accordance with the Constitution:
the rule of law. The Sovereign is a part of
Parliament, playing an important, non-partisan
role as the focus of citizenship and allegiance,
most visibly during royal visits to Canada. Her
Majesty is a symbol of Canadian sovereignty,
a guardian of constitutional freedoms, and a
reflection of our history. The Royal Family’s
example of lifelong service to the community is
an encouragement for citizens to give their best
to their country. As Head of the Commonwealth,
the Sovereign links Canada to 53 other nations
that cooperate to advance social, economic
and cultural progress. Other constitutional
monarchies include Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
Australia, New Zealand, The Netherlands, Spain,
Thailand, Japan, Jordan and Morocco.
There is a clear distinction in Canada between
the head of state—the Sovereign—and the head
of government—the Prime Minister, who actually
directs the governing of the country.
The Sovereign is represented in Canada by the
Governor General, who is appointed by the
Sovereign on the advice of the Prime Minister,
usually for five years. In each of the ten provinces,
the Sovereign is represented by the Lieutenant
Governor, who is appointed by the Governor
General on the advice of the Prime Minister, also
normally for five years.

Each provincial and territorial government has
an elected legislature where provincial and
territorial laws are passed. The members of the
legislature are called members of the Legislative
Assembly (MLAs), members of the National
Assembly (MNAs), members of the Provincial
Parliament (MPPs) or members of the House of
Assembly (MHAs), depending on the province or
territory.

Federal Elections
Canadians vote in elections for the people they want to represent them in the House of Commons. In each
election, voters may re-elect the same members of the House of Commons or choose new ones. Members
of the House of Commons are also known as members of Parliament or MPs.

Under legislation passed by Parliament, federal
elections must be held on the third Monday in
October every four years following the most
recent general election. The Prime Minister
may ask the Governor General to call an earlier
election.

Voting

Secret ballot

One of the privileges of Canadian citizenship
is the right to vote. You are eligible to vote in
a federal election or cast a ballot in a federal
referendum if you are:

Canada is divided into 308 electoral districts, also
known as ridings or constituencies. An electoral
district is a geographical area represented by a
member of Parliament (MP). The citizens in each
electoral district elect one MP who sits in the
House of Commons to represent them, as well as
all Canadians.

• a Canadian citizen; and

Canadian law secures the right to a secret ballot.
This means that no one can watch you vote and
no one should look at how you voted. You may
choose to discuss how you voted with others, but
no one, including family members, your employer
or union representative, has the right to insist
that you tell them how you voted. Immediately
after the polling stations close, election officers
count the ballots and the results are announced
on radio and television, and in the newspapers.

Canadian citizens who are 18 years old or older
may run in a federal election. The people who
run for office are called candidates. There can be
many candidates in an electoral district.
The people in each electoral district vote for the
candidate and political party of their choice. The
candidate who receives the most votes becomes
the MP for that electoral district.

• at least 18 years old on voting day; and
• on the voters’ list.
The voters’ lists used during federal elections
and referendums are produced from the
National Register of Electors by a neutral agency
of Parliament called Elections Canada. This is
a permanent database of Canadian citizens 18
years of age or older who are qualified to vote in
federal elections and referendums.
Once an election has been called, Elections
Canada mails a voter information card to each
elector whose name is in the National Register
of Electors. The card lists when and where you
vote and the number to call if you require an
interpreter or other special services.
Even if you choose not to be listed in the National
Register of Electors or do not receive a voter
information card, you can still be added to the
voters’ list at any time, including on election day.

Ordinarily, after an election, the leader of the
political party with the most seats in the House
of Commons is invited by the Governor General
to form the government. After being appointed
by the Governor General, the leader of this party
becomes the Prime Minister. If the party in power
holds at least half of the seats in the House of
Commons, this is called a majority government.
If the party in power holds less than half of the
seats in the House of Commons, this is called a
minority government.
The Prime Minister and the party in power run
the government as long as they have the support
or confidence of the majority of the MPs. When
the House of Commons votes on a major issue

The Prime Minister chooses the ministers of the
Crown, most of them from among members of
the House of Commons. Cabinet ministers are
responsible for running the federal government
departments. The Prime Minister and the
Cabinet ministers are called the Cabinet and
they make important decisions about how the
country is governed. They prepare the budget
and propose most new laws. Their decisions can
be questioned by all members of the House of
Commons.
The other parties that are not in power are known
as opposition parties. The opposition party with
the most members of the House of Commons is
the Official Opposition or Her Majesty’s Loyal
Opposition. The role of opposition parties is to
peacefully oppose or try to improve government
proposals. There are three major political parties
currently represented in the House of Commons:
the Conservative Party, the New Democratic
Party, and the Liberal Party.

Courts
The Supreme Court of Canada is our country’s
highest court. The Federal Court of Canada deals
with matters concerning the federal government.
In most provinces there is an appeal court and
a trial court, sometimes called the Court of
Queen’s Bench or the Supreme Court. There are
also provincial courts for lesser offences, family
courts, traffic courts and small claims courts for
civil cases involving small sums of money.

Police
The police are there to keep people safe and to
enforce the law. You can ask the police for help
in all kinds of situations—if there’s been an
accident, if someone has stolen something from
you, if you are a victim of assault, if you see a
crime taking place or if someone you know has
gone missing.

You can also question the police about their
service or conduct if you feel you need to. Almost
all police forces in Canada have a process by
which you can bring your concerns to the police
and seek action.

Getting legal help
Lawyers can help you with legal problems and act
for you in court. If you cannot pay for a lawyer,

democratic principles and due process. Due process is the principle that the government must respect all
the legal rights a person is entitled to under the law.
Scales of Justice,

The blindfolded Lady
Justice symbolizes
the impartial manner
in which our laws are
administered: blind to
all considerations but

Courts
The Supreme Court of Canada is our country’s
highest court. The Federal Court of Canada deals
with matters concerning the federal government.
In most provinces there is an appeal court and
a trial court, sometimes called the Court of
Queen’s Bench or the Supreme Court. There are
also provincial courts for lesser offences, family
courts, traffic courts and small claims courts for
civil cases involving small sums of money.

Police
The police are there to keep people safe and to
enforce the law. You can ask the police for help
in all kinds of situations—if there’s been an
accident, if someone has stolen something from
you, if you are a victim of assault, if you see a
crime taking place or if someone you know has
gone missing.

You can also question the police about their
service or conduct if you feel you need to. Almost
all police forces in Canada have a process by
which you can bring your concerns to the police
and seek action.

Getting legal help
Lawyers can help you with legal problems and act
for you in court. If you cannot pay for a lawyer,
in most communities there are legal aid services
available free of charge or at a low cost.

Canada has many important symbols — objects, events, and people that have special meaning. Together
they help explain what it means to be Canadian and express our national identity. Important Canadian
symbols appear throughout this booklet.

The Royal Arms
of Canada

A new Canadian flag was raised for the first time
in 1965. The red-white-red pattern comes from
the flag of the Royal Military College, Kingston,
founded in 1876. Red and white had been colours
of France and England since the Middle Ages and
the national colours of Canada since 1921. The
Union Jack is our official Royal Flag. The Canadian
Red Ensign served as the Canadian flag for about
100 years. The provinces and territories also have
flags that embody their distinct traditions.

The maple leaf
The maple leaf is Canada’s best-known symbol.
Maple leaves were adopted as a symbol by
French Canadians in the 1700s, have appeared

Coat of arms and motto
As an expression of national pride after the First
World War, Canada adopted an official coat of
arms and a national motto, A mari usque ad
mare, which in Latin means “from sea to sea.”
The arms contain symbols of England, France,
Scotland and Ireland as well as red maple leaves.
Today the arms can be seen on dollar bills,
government documents and public buildings.

Parliament buildings
The towers, arches, sculptures and stained glass
of the Parliament Buildings embody the French,
English and Aboriginal traditions and the Gothic
Revival architecture popular in the time of Queen

Hockey is Canada’s most popular spectator
sport and is considered to be the national winter
sport. Ice hockey was developed in Canada in
the 1800s. The National Hockey League plays
for the championship Stanley Cup, donated by
Lord Stanley, the Governor General, in 1892. The
Clarkson Cup, established in 2005 by Adrienne
Clarkson, the 26th Governor General (and the first
of Asian origin), is awarded for women’s hockey.
Many young Canadians play hockey at school, in
a hockey league or on quiet streets—road hockey
or street hockey—and are taken to the hockey
rink by their parents. Canadian children have
collected hockey cards for generations.
Canadian football is the second most popular
sport (see page 26). Curling, an ice game
introduced by Scottish pioneers, is popular.

English and French are the two official languages
and are important symbols of identity. English
speakers (Anglophones) and French speakers
(Francophones) have lived together in
partnership and creative tension for more than
300 years. You must have adequate knowledge
of English or French to become a Canadian
citizen. Adult applicants 55 years of age or over
are exempted from this requirement.

The Atlantic provinces
Atlantic Canada’s coasts and natural resources, including fishing, farming, forestry and mining, have
made these provinces an important part of Canada’s history and development. The Atlantic Ocean brings
cool winters and cool humid summers.

Newfoundland and Labrador

Newfoundland and Labrador is the most easterly point in North America and has its own time zone. In
addition to its natural beauty, the province has a unique heritage linked to the sea. The oldest colony of
the British Empire and a strategic prize in Canada’s early history, the province has long been known for its
fisheries, coastal fishing villages and distinct culture. Today off-shore oil and gas extraction contributes a
substantial part of the economy. Labrador also has immense hydro-electric resources.

New Brunswick

Situated in the Appalachian Range, the province was founded by the United Empire Loyalists and has
the second largest river system on North America’s Atlantic coastline, the St. John River system. Forestry,
agriculture, fisheries, mining, food processing and tourism are the principal industries. Saint John is
the largest city, port and manufacturing centre; Moncton is the principal Francophone Acadian centre;
and Fredericton, the historic capital. New Brunswick is the only officially bilingual province, and about
one-third of the population lives and works in French. The province’s pioneer Loyalist and French cultural
heritage and history come alive in street festivals and traditional music.

Central canada
More than half the people in Canada live in cities and towns near the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence
River in southern Quebec and Ontario, known as Central Canada and the industrial and manufacturing
heartland. Southern Ontario and Quebec have cold winters and warm humid summers. Together, Ontario
and Quebec produce more than three-quarters of all Canadian manufactured goods.

Prince Edward Island
Quebec
Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.) is the smallest province, known for its beaches, red soil and agriculture,
especially potatoes. P.E.I. is the birthplace of Confederation, connected to mainland Canada by one of
the longest continuous multispan bridges in the world, the Confederation Bridge. Anne of Green Gables,
set in P.E.I. by Lucy Maud Montgomery, is a much-loved story about the adventures of a little red-headed
orphan girl.

Nova Scotia

Nearly eight million people live in Quebec, the vast majority along or near the St. Lawrence River. More
than three-quarters speak French as their first language. The resources of the Canadian Shield have helped
Quebec to develop important industries, including forestry, energy and mining. Quebec is Canada’s main
producer of pulp and paper. The province’s huge supply of fresh water has made it Canada’s largest
producer of hydro-electricity. Quebecers are leaders in cutting-edge industries such as pharmaceuticals
and aeronautics. Quebec films, music, literary works and food have international stature, especially in
La Francophonie, an association of French-speaking nations. Montreal, Canada’s second largest city and
the second largest mainly French-speaking city in the world after Paris, is famous for its cultural diversity.

Nova Scotia is the most populous Atlantic Province, with a rich history as the gateway to Canada. Known
for the world’s highest tides in the Bay of Fundy, the province’s identity is linked to shipbuilding, fisheries
and shipping. As Canada’s largest east coast port, deep-water and ice-free, the capital, Halifax, has
played an important role in Atlantic trade and defence and is home to Canada’s largest naval base. Nova
Scotia has a long history of coal mining, forestry and agriculture. Today there is also off-shore oil and gas
exploration. The province’s Celtic and Gaelic traditions sustain a vibrant culture. Nova Scotia is home to
over 700 annual festivals, including the spectacular military tattoo in Halifax.

Ontario

Alberta

At more than 12 million, the people of Ontario make up more than one-third of Canadians. The large
and culturally diverse population, natural resources and strategic location contribute to a vital economy.
Toronto is the largest city in Canada and the country’s main financial centre. Many people work in the
service or manufacturing industries, which produce a large percentage of Canada’s exports. The Niagara
region is known for its vineyards, wines and fruit crops. Ontario farmers raise dairy and beef cattle, poultry,
and vegetable and grain crops. Founded by United Empire Loyalists, Ontario also has the largest Frenchspeaking population outside of Quebec, with a proud history of preserving their language and culture.
There are five Great Lakes located between Ontario and the United States: Lake Ontario, Lake Erie, Lake
Huron, Lake Michigan (in the U.S.A.) and Lake Superior, the largest freshwater lake in the world.

Alberta is the most populous Prairie province. The province, and the world-famous Lake Louise in the
Rocky Mountains, were both named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta, fourth daughter of Queen
Victoria. Alberta has five national parks, including Banff National Park, established in 1885. The rugged
Badlands house some of the world’s richest deposits of prehistoric fossils and dinosaur finds. Alberta is
the largest producer of oil and gas, and the oil sands in the north are being developed as a major energy
source. Alberta is also renowned for agriculture, especially for the vast cattle ranches that make Canada
one of the world’s major beef producers.

The West Coast
The Prairie Provinces
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta are the Prairie Provinces, rich in energy resources and some of the
most fertile farmland in the world. The region is mostly dry, with cold winters and hot summers.

British Columbia is known for its majestic mountains and as Canada’s Pacific gateway. The Port of
Vancouver, Canada’s largest and busiest, handles billions of dollars in goods traded around the world.
Warm airstreams from the Pacific Ocean give the B.C. coast a temperate climate.

British Columbia
Manitoba

Manitoba’s economy is based on agriculture, mining and hydro-electric power generation. The province’s
most populous city is Winnipeg, whose Exchange District includes the most famous street intersection
in Canada, Portage and Main. Winnipeg’s French Quarter, St. Boniface, has Western Canada’s largest
Francophone community at 45,000. Manitoba is also an important centre of Ukrainian culture, with 14%
reporting Ukrainian origins, and the largest Aboriginal population of any province, at over 15%.

British Columbia (B.C.), on the Pacific coast, is Canada’s westernmost province, with a population of
four million. The Port of Vancouver is our gateway to the Asia-Pacific. About one-half of all the goods
produced in B.C. are forestry products, including lumber, newsprint, and pulp and paper products—the
most valuable forestry industry in Canada. B.C. is also known for mining, fishing, and the fruit orchards
and wine industry of the Okanagan Valley. B.C. has the most extensive park system in Canada, with
approximately 600 provincial parks. The province’s large Asian communities have made Chinese and
Punjabi the most spoken languages in the cities after English. The capital, Victoria, is a tourist centre and
headquarters of the navy’s Pacific fleet.

The Northern Territories
The Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon contain one-third of Canada’s land mass but have a
population of only 100,000. There are gold, lead, copper, diamond and zinc mines. Oil and gas deposits
are being developed. The North is often referred to as the “Land of the Midnight Sun” because at the
height of summer, daylight can last up to 24 hours. In winter, the sun disappears and darkness sets in for
three months. The Northern territories have long cold winters and short cool summers. Much of the North
is made up of tundra, the vast rocky Arctic plain. Because of the cold Arctic climate, there are no trees
on the tundra and the soil is permanently frozen. Some continue to earn a living by hunting, fishing and
trapping. Inuit art is sold throughout Canada and around the world.

Yukon

Thousands of miners came to the Yukon during the Gold Rush of the 1890s, as celebrated in the poetry of
Robert W. Service. Mining remains a significant part of the economy. The White Pass and Yukon Railway
opened from Skagway in neighbouring Alaska to the territorial capital, Whitehorse, in 1900 and provides
a spectacular tourist excursion across precipitous passes and bridges. Yukon holds the record for the
coldest temperature ever recorded in Canada (-63°C).

Nunavut

Nunavut, meaning “our land” in Inuktitut, was established in 1999 from the eastern part of the Northwest
Territories, including all of the former District of Keewatin. The capital is Iqaluit, formerly Frobisher Bay,
named after the English explorer Martin Frobisher, who penetrated the uncharted Arctic for Queen
Elizabeth I in 1576. The 19-member Legislative Assembly chooses a premier and ministers by consensus.
The population is about 85% Inuit, and Inuktitut is an official language and the first language in schools.

The Canadian Rangers
Canada’s vast North brings security and sovereignty challenges. Dealing with harsh weather conditions
in an isolated region, the Canadian Rangers, part of the Canadian Forces Reserves (militia), play a key
role. Drawing on indigenous knowledge and experience, the Rangers travel by snowmobile in the winter
and all-terrain vehicles in the summer from Resolute to the Magnetic North Pole, and keep the flag flying
in Canada’s Arctic.

Mount Logan, located in
the Yukon, is the highest
mountain in Canada. It
is named in honour of
Sir William Logan, a
world-famous geologist,
born in Montreal in 1798
to Scottish immigrant
parents. Logan founded

“For here [in Canada],
I want the marble to remain the marble;

a free Canadian,
free to speak without fear,
